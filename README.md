# PIMPS Standalone - Development version

### Personalised Information Metrics Pulled from STRAVA (PIMPS)

**NOTE:** This is currently an in-development demo project for learning purposes. PIMPS Standalone is a Java command line application that is built on the Spring Framework.

STRAVA is a social network for athletes which allows users to upload and store their activity data (cycling, running, swimming) from their monitoring device. It then enables the analysis of the activity data and also comparison with other users data.

STRAVA provides a RESTful API to access this data, which is what PIMPS uses. PIMPS uses the STRAVA API to provide customised sports performance data reporting.
